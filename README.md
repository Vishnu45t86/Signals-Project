# Signals-Project FOURIER TRANSFORM OF AUDIO SIGNAL
A device was developed that can capture audio signals making use of an Arduino board and a
microphone. The Fourier transform of the audio signal was obtained using the code written in
MATLAB. This output gives us the real-time amplitude vs. frequency graph. The quality of the
recorded audio data could be improved by using more advanced microphones or by optimizing
the electronic circuit used to connect the microphone to the Arduino board
